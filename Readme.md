# Starting out in Data science

This is a short collection of notes for what I think beginners should focus on learning and getting right rather than <insert name of cool framework>

**Good software development**
Being able to write decent code that others (and you) can read and use is essential.  Code might be written once but read hundreds of time, so *x in y for z* gets really difficult to follow pretty quickly.

1.  If you arent already writing code inline with PEP8 these are two useful guides

2. Know how to use git this is a great intro https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
Set up a github and know how to use it.  Ideally start  personal project on it

3. Understand cloud computing
Most companies are using one of the 3 main cloud providers (Amazon web services, Google cloud platform and Microsoft Azure) in some form and this is likely to continue.  My recommendation is the AWS cloud Developer Associate course by acloudguru https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate/


**ML**
Focus on understanding linear/logistic regression and limitations/ assumptions
Understand how common ML algorithms works

**Stats**
Probability 
Conditional probability

If you havent touched this since cool, Khan Academy is fab place to start khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability

**Data cleaning**

#### *“Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” –– Leo Tolstoy*

#### *“Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” –– Hadley Wickham*

Most of my time on data science projects has been spent cleaning data, this has often been time-consuming and painful. Being familiar with how to clean data and deal with missing/improbable values in a sensible manner is a key skill

Pipelines in sklearn pipelines are a tool to set up data processing in a reproducible way, this is a fab intro: https://www.kaggle.com/baghern/a-deep-dive-into-sklearn-pipelines 

A slightly more advanced course that I really enjoyed ishttps://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models/  - the instructors are fantastic.


**Coding tests**
hackerrank and leetcode are good places to practice coding questions

Ideally do a personal project

**Data sources**
Open data.gov
Data.world

**CV** 

Use the STAR method to describe a project, include the outcomes and ideally figures to quantify your effect.

**Situation**: Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. You
must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in
the past. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand. This situation can be
from a previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.
**Task**: What goal were you working toward?
**Action**: Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of
detail and keep the focus on YOU. What specific steps did you take and what was your particular
contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a
project, but what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we” when describing actions.
**Result**: Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your
behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you
learn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.
